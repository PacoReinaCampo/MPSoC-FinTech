# MPSoC-FinTech WIKI

## Definition

A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security.

An Automation Financial Method (AFM) is the technology and innovation that aims to compete with Traditional Financial Methods in the delivery of financial services. It is an emerging industry that uses technology to improve activities in finance. AFM is the new applications, processes, products, or business models in the financial services industry, composed of complementary financial services and provided as an end-to-end process via the Internet.
